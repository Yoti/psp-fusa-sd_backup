![FuSa SD - PSP Slim TV-out plugin](logo-sd.png)

## What is it?

FuSa is a plugin developed by **OldPrisoneR** and **Andy_maN** that enables PSP Slim to use any TV-out cable type. 

This includes the composite, S-Video, and D-Terminal TV-out connections.

> FuSa allows a user to use the Interlace mode of the PSP 2000 to play games over the cables. Previously, this was only allowed via Progressive mode. However, not everyone had access to this (in 2008) as Progressive mode required a HDTV (high-definition television) that could handle Progressive Mode, which was not so common in those years.

### About HD version

FuSa HD was an attemp to use onboard OpenGL as a grafics filter to produce more smooth picture.
However it could not run perfectly for most games. The beta stage was frozen.
It was available only for betatesters on fusa website. 

Now you can find it on Patreon or Boosty. (see links above)
